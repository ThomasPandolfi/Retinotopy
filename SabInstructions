Some nomenclature
	CW and CCW = clockwise and counterclockwise
	EXP and CONT = expanding and contracting rings
	CWEXP = Clockwise + expanding ring
	comb = all 4 runs combined
	
In order to run any .sh file, just run in terminal ./__thefile__.sh
In order to run any python program, in terminal python3 ./__thefile__.py

Put all Subject folders on the desktop
	Name them something simple and consistent, I rec SUBJ05 for example

In these folders, there should be one folder for MRI Pre, and one for MRI Post
	Name them consistently, MRIPre and MRIPost are my usual choice
In the MRIPre or MRIPost folder, there should be a folder with ALL of the dicom images in each of their scan folders (call it predcm)
The directory should look like
Desktop --> SUBJ05 --> MRIPre --> predcm --> Each of the scan folders




The important files needed for script running are in a folder on the desktop (Scripting_for_DellLinux)
In the folder:
	Combination.py
		Used for combining the wedge runs together, Used for combining Rings, Used for Combining all 4, Used for making hybrids (CWEXP)
	norm.py
		Used for filtering the data with a lowpass / highpass filter
	R2.py
		Main analysis python script for displaying the calculated visual fields
	subdetails.sh
		IMPORTANT - this is where you edit the important differences in the subject you are running
		The following variables should be changed if needed
		fresurName='SMTEST'        This should be the name you registered the participant as with freesurfer, (initial then subjnumber then pre or post)
		niiLocation='/home/thomaszeph/Desktop/Stacey_MRI/test/analysis/main' (should be desktop/subjectfolder/mripre or post / analysis / main
		GauSigTemp=70 #temporal smoothing parameter
		GauSigSpat=3 #Spatial smoothing parameter
		LFcut=0.001 #Low frequency cutoff
		HFcut=0.30 #high frequency cutoff
		
		
	combinedruns.sh
		The master shell script for doing everything at once. In here are commented sections of code for running section by section
			if you want to go section by section just highlight and copy code, paste into terminal - often better than running all at once in case of errors
	Realign_script.m
		Matlab script to adjust the mri files for movement

The pipeline of combinedruns.sh is as follows:
	Starts freesurfer
	Unpack all the dcm files into a nice and neat directory structure
	Run freesurfers recon-all to register the participant and segment the cortex
		Likely this never really works properly on stroke victims (has to be modified manually - i literally have no idea how to)
	Source the subdetails.sh file, make a bunch of important variables and create a directory
	Run Combination.py
		If you already combined files, comment out this line to not waste time
	Run realign_script.m
		If you already combined files and realigned them, comment out this line
	Run norm.py
		If you are already happy with your filtering parameters (ONLY low pass / high pass), comment this out
	Create a config file for the analysis (look for the following lines)
		echo varNumX = 23 >> $ConfigLocation
		echo varNumY = 23 >> $ConfigLocation         (23 is standard (number of degrees modeled, you can do more (46, but takes way longer)))
		echo varNumPrfSizes = 14 >> $ConfigLocation    (number of sizes of the field modeled, 14 is PROBABLY ok)
	
		echo lstPathPng = [\'/home/tp/Desktop/Scripting_For_DellLinux/pyprf/${actualOrder[${value}]}/frame_\'] >> $ConfigLocation
			Directory of where to find the stim frames (take a look at the directory pyprf in the scripting file to confirm)
	
	
	Runs the analysis (CALLED PYPRF) and saves everything (takes a WHILE to do analysis on the comb file)


If you don't want to do analysis on some of the files, like for example you DONT want to analyze the comb file, look for this line
	for value in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7; do
		and remove the numbers you DONT want to do
		009 011 013 015 comb 00wedges 00rings 00cwexp
		0 = CW 
		1 = CCW
		2 = EXP
		3 = CONT
		4 = Combined
		5 = Wedges combined
		6 = Rings Combined
		7 = CW + EXP
		
Also note, running the analysis of the combined pyprf file is significantly longer than all of the other runs COMBINED in time length due to file size


Issues that you will need to workaround
	When combining files the voxel intensity of the last timeseries step  of the FIRST FILE is often different than the voxel intensity of hte first timeseries step of the SECOND FILE. This results in a modeling error which can be potentially very large
	If you can't segment the T1 anatomical correctly, you cant utilize any of the freesurfer features for analysis, including doing analysis on the MRI surface and not in volume space.
	the lowpass and highpass cutoffs are arbitrary, although its better to be more conservative with filters
		I commonly used 0.005 and 0.5 or so, should only slightly smooth data which is the goal
	



Results can be visualized with FSLeyes (from terminal type fsleyes)
In order to view the anatomical and freesurfer registration with tksurfer, copy each of these blocks into terminal, and replace TP00 with the subject initials and number
	This displays the T1 with white matter, segments out the skull, and applies shaders to see the segmented brain
